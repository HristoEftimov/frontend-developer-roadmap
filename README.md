# Front-end Developer Roadmap

Roadmap to becoming a front-end developer in 2017!

You can (soon be able to) find here the technologies that you would want to adopt in order to become a junior, a middle or a senior level front-end developer.

# How to contribute

The roadmaps are built using [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/). The main project file is the `roadmap.xml`.

To modify the roadmaps:

1. Fork the repository
1. Open [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/). **File** -> **Open from** -> **GitHub** -> *Select the fork you made in the previous step.*
1. Do your changes via the draw.io interface. Save (commit) once in a while.

Finally, open a pull request with your changes. Please *upload an image* of the roadmap in the pull request description, for an easier review process.
